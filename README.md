# Title of the project:

Eye Exercise

# Description of the project:

Using the mouse as a focus, the animated eyes follow the mouse wherever it moves on the screen. The eyes stay in the center of the screen but the pupils move to follow the mouse. This exercise displayed a single eye. I added another eye so that both would be evenly distributed on the screen.

# How to Run:

- Clone this repo
- Open the index.html file in a browser
- Move the mouse around the screen and watch the eyes follow it

# Roadmap of future improvements:

- Translate this into a game where a fly swatter automatically moves around the screen try to swat the mouse and the player has to avoid it
